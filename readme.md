# Quick Fix

This repository is to showcase the mobile application.

## Description

Quick-Fix helps to connect students with broken, repairable items with those who have the skills to fix them. By doing this, Quick-Fix will facilitate the reuse of items instead of simply throwing them out and purchasing more. By providing a platform that connects providers of repair services to those in need of repairs, Quick-Fix will make it easier for users to find the services they require. This app is for anyone looking for a quick repair in their local area for a fraction of the time and cost of replacing their damaged items. It is also for experts who are looking to provide their services on their own terms to a wide audience. Apart from providing a useful service for the appâ€™s users, Quick-Fix will also help to reduce the production of various kinds of waste, from textiles to electrical products.
